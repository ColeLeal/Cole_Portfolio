# [Project 1: Fraud_Detection_Project](https://github.com/ColeLeal/Fraud_Detection_Project)
Within this notebook I've sought to display a few data science skills on a binary classification data set involving 
the detection of credit card fraud.
*   I have displayed some quick EDA in the beginning so that we may grasp some understanding of the data set.
*   Then I went into spot checking different types of models from ensemble to deep learning to see which models are viable in solving our problem.
*   I then attempted to remedy the unbalanced nature of the data set via over and undersampling methods.
*   Lastly I tuned the two best models from spot checking and came to the final/settled result.
